#### Getting started:

1. Install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) and [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads).
2. Start the Mongo server by opening a new terminal tab and typing `mongod`.
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`
4. Obtain the super secret config file by contacting [Joe](https://github.com/JSlote) or [David](https://github.com/dpikt) if you're interested in working on this project.
5. Run server with `npm start`, run api test with `npm test`

#### Contributing:
1. Fork or branch `dev` then submit a PR back to `dev`.
2. We'll review it and merge it into `dev` if it's ready.
3. As necessary, we'll merge `dev` into `master`.
4. Our production server will automatically update based on changes in `master` *DO NOT* submit PRs to `master` or attempt to push directly to `master` because this branch must be kept pristine and production-ready at all times.
