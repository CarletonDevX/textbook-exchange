#### Getting started:

1. Install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) and [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads).
2. Start the Mongo server by opening a new terminal tab and typing `mongod`.
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`
4. Run server with `npm start`, run api test with `npm test`

P.S. You will also need a super secret config file to get this thing running. Contact [Joe](https://github.com/JSlote) or [David](https://github.com/dpikt) if you're interested in working on this project.
