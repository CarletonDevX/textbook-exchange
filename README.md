#### Getting started:

1. Install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) and [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads).
2. Start the Mongo server by opening a new terminal tab and typing `mongod`.
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`
4. Run server with `node server.js`

Right now the only thing the app does is display a list of registered users.

I'm still working my way through [this tutorial](https://hackhands.com/how-to-get-started-on-the-mean-stack/).
