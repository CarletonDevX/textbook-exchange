      h4 Hit the Books is a service for buying and selling used textbooks. 
      | No need to browse Facebook or pester your upperclassmen friends- 
      | we’ll help you find other students who have the textbooks you need.
      h4 All transactions are face-to-face.
      | HTB isn’t a paid service or online marketplace. It’s more like a search engine for books and students. 
      | The only “transaction” we handle is an initial email to let other students know you’re interested in buying or 
      | selling. You can take it from there!
      h4 Finding a textbook is simple.
      ul
        li Start by searching for the book.
        li The book page will show you any members who are offering the book.
        li If you see a price you like, click “Make An Offer” to send them an email.
        li If you don’t see any listings, you can still add the book to your watchlist to get an email notifying you if anyone lists it in the future.
      h4 Selling a textbook is simple too!
      ul
        li Start by searching for the book.

        li You can review your available listings, and your watchlist, on your user page.
      h4 Have fun, and let us know if you have any questions or ideas for the site!
